package=transformers; Hugging Face Transformers MaskFormer Model Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Hugging Face Transformers. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of model files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-25191.
package=transformers; Hugging Face Transformers MobileViTV2 Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Hugging Face Transformers. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of configuration files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-24322.
package=transformers; The huggingface/transformers library is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data within the load_repo_checkpoint() function of the TFPreTrainedModel() class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized payload, exploiting the use of pickle.load() on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine.
package=transformers; Deserialization of Untrusted Data in GitHub repository huggingface/transformers prior to 4.36.0.
package=transformers; The huggingface/transformers library, versions prior to 4.53.0, is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the AdamWeightDecay optimizer. The vulnerability arises from the _do_use_weight_decay method, which processes user-controlled regular expressions in the include_in_weight_decay and exclude_from_weight_decay lists. Malicious regular expressions can cause catastrophic backtracking during the re.search call, leading to 100% CPU utilization and a denial of service. This issue can be exploited by attackers who can control the patterns in these lists, potentially causing the machine learning task to hang and rendering services unresponsive.
package=transformers; A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically affecting the MarianTokenizer's remove_language_code() method. This vulnerability is present in version 4.52.4 and has been fixed in version 4.53.0. The issue arises from inefficient regex processing, which can be exploited by crafted input strings containing malformed language code patterns, leading to excessive CPU consumption and potential denial of service.
package=transformers; A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was identified in the huggingface/transformers library, specifically in the file tokenization_nougat_fast.py. The vulnerability occurs in the post_process_single() function, where a regular expression processes specially crafted input. The issue stems from the regex exhibiting exponential time complexity under certain conditions, leading to excessive backtracking. This can result in significantly high CPU usage and potential application downtime, effectively creating a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario. The affected version is v4.46.3.
package=transformers; A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) exists in the preprocess_string() function of the transformers.testing_utils module. In versions before 4.50.0, the regex used to process code blocks in docstrings contains nested quantifiers that can trigger catastrophic backtracking when given inputs with many newline characters. An attacker who can supply such input to preprocess_string() (or code paths that call it) can force excessive CPU usage and degrade availability. Fix: released in 4.50.0, which rewrites the regex to avoid the inefficient pattern. ([GitHub][1]) Affected: < 4.50.0 Patched: 4.50.0
package=transformers; A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the get_imports() function within dynamic_module_utils.py. This vulnerability affects versions 4.49.0 and is fixed in version 4.51.0. The issue arises from a regular expression pattern \s*try\s*:.*?except.*?: used to filter out try/except blocks from Python code, which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to remote code loading disruption, resource exhaustion in model serving, supply chain attack vectors, and development pipeline disruption.
package=transformers; A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the get_configuration_file() function within the transformers.configuration_utils module. The affected version is 4.49.0, and the issue is resolved in version 4.51.0. The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular expression pattern config\.(.*)\.json that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings, leading to catastrophic backtracking. This can result in model serving disruption, resource exhaustion, and increased latency in applications using the library.
package=transformers; A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically within the DonutProcessor class's token2json() method. This vulnerability affects versions 4.51.3 and earlier, and is fixed in version 4.52.1. The issue arises from the regex pattern <s_(.*?)> which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities, impacting document processing tasks using the Donut model.
package=transformers; Hugging Face Transformers versions up to 4.49.0 are affected by an improper input validation vulnerability in the image_utils.py file. The vulnerability arises from insecure URL validation using the startswith() method, which can be bypassed through URL username injection. This allows attackers to craft URLs that appear to be from YouTube but resolve to malicious domains, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or data exfiltration. The issue is fixed in version 4.52.1.
