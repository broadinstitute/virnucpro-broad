## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. CLI parameter --merge-threads
expected: Running `virnucpro predict --help` shows --merge-threads option with description. Default is auto-detection (uses CPU count). User can specify explicit value.
result: issue
reported: "Would it be better to have one catch-all threads parameter here or are there considerations that drive needing a different parameter?"
severity: minor

### 2. Automatic parallel merge activation
expected: Running prediction pipeline with multiple nucleotide/protein feature file pairs on multi-core system automatically uses parallel merge without requiring --merge-threads flag. Log shows "Using parallel merge with N workers".
result: skipped

### 3. Sequential fallback for single file
expected: Running prediction pipeline with only one feature file pair uses sequential merge (no parallel overhead). Log shows "Using sequential merge (single file or single core)".
result: issue
reported: "I used a single file input and see parallel merging: Using parallel merge with 48 workers. Merge complete: 5/5 files successful. Is this normal?"
severity: minor

### 4. Explicit --merge-threads control
expected: Running with `--merge-threads 2` uses exactly 2 workers for merge, regardless of CPU count. Log confirms worker count.
result: pass

### 5. Progress reporting during merge
expected: During feature merge stage, progress bar shows "Merging features" with file count and completion percentage. Updates in real-time as files are processed.
result: pass

### 6. Checkpoint/resume behavior
expected: If merge is interrupted and rerun, already-merged output files are skipped (not reprocessed). Log shows "Skipping merge - output exists" for completed files.
result: skipped

### 7. Partial failure handling
expected: If some file pairs fail to merge (e.g., missing files, mismatched sequences), pipeline continues with successful merges and logs warning about failures. Does not crash entire pipeline.
result: skipped

### 8. Performance improvement
expected: With multiple CPU cores and multiple file pairs (e.g., 10+ pairs on 4+ cores), parallel merge completes significantly faster than sequential would. At least 1.5-2x speedup observable.
result: pass
