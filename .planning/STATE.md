# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-22)

**Core value:** Embedding steps (DNABERT-S and ESM-2) efficiently utilize all available GPUs and automatically queue batches, reducing sample processing time from 45+ hours to under 10 hours.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - ESM-2 Multi-GPU Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (ESM-2 Multi-GPU Foundation)
Plan: Not yet planned
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-01-22 — Roadmap created with 6 phases covering all 31 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: None yet
- Trend: N/A

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Focus on embeddings only: ESM-2 is 45-hour bottleneck, biggest ROI
- Target <10 hours for one sample: 4.5x speedup from current 45 hours
- Maintain CLI interface: Users have existing workflows and scripts
- Open to new dependencies: Willing to add libraries (DeepSpeed, Ray) if they accelerate significantly

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 Critical:**
- CUDA context initialization in parent process causes "cannot re-initialize CUDA" errors — must defer ALL CUDA operations to worker functions
- Batch size variability can fragment memory even with available VRAM — implement sequence sorting and expandable segments from start
- Checkpoint corruption from partial writes — use atomic temp-then-rename pattern

**Phase 4 Research:**
- FlashAttention-2 compatibility with fair-esm library (ESM-2) needs verification during planning — DNABERT-S integration is straightforward
